# TEAM PROFILE GENERATOR

## USAGE

This application is designed for a manager to be able to enter his/her information (name, ID, email, and office number ) to be displayed on a webpage, along with any team members (engineers and interns) he/she chooses.  The app will loop through the main menu question "Add Engineer, Add Intern, or Done adding members" until the manager is done selecting their team.  Adding team members (engineers or interns) will create a front-end display of the manager's team that they created with all the information that they provided.
